How to run the project:

Run the program without running the crawler first:

Download Webpages folder from https://github.com/virashree/CrwledData
Include it under the project directory
path to the directory is already set in the code

Include crawler.py, index.py, queries.txt, stopwords.txt, textProcessor.py in the project directory

After you run the program it should print the list of ranks pages for all the queries on the console.

To run the crawler:
If You want to run the crawler and then see the result then uncomment the code in crwelr.py file under main function
Please note that this is single threaded crawler so if you run it , it will take quite a lot of time to finish the whole process.
